      A short-code represents a temporary password used to grant a one-time access to a specific resource.
      Once a resource is accessed using a short code, the short code is expired.
      Every short-code also has a limited lifespan. Once expired, it cannot be used anymore.

      Credentials are used to prove a user identity. Using those credentials, a user can request a token with higher

      Users are the entities that can authenticate to the service. They can have different roles, and access different
